test_results: |
  Validation rerun on 2026-02-16:
  - npm --prefix vscode-temple-linter run compile (pass)
  - npm --prefix vscode-temple-linter run lint (pass)
  - npm --prefix vscode-temple-linter run test:integration
    (fails in sandbox: VS Code test run terminates with SIGABRT after host launch;
    updater lookup also reports ENOTFOUND for update.code.visualstudio.com and
    falls back to cached 1.109.3)
notes:
  - Validation started on 2026-02-16.
  - Compile/lint pass for updated extension source.
  - Integration test run currently blocked by VS Code test-host SIGABRT in this sandboxed environment; needs rerun in local IDE host/CI environment.
  - '2026-02-16: Shadow-bridge parity effort tracked in items 89-94 with explicit extension matrix and PR slice boundaries.'
  - '2026-02-16: Status re-verified prior to starting 89+.':
      - Compile/lint still pass.
      - Integration remains blocked in sandbox (SIGABRT), so item stays in-progress.
  - '2026-02-16: Revalidated after 89-94 implementation updates.':
      - Extension compile/lint still pass with projection-backed shadow bridge.
      - Python projection/transport/integration suites pass.
      - VS Code integration host still terminates with SIGABRT in sandbox; release
        gate remains pending unsandboxed host validation.
      - 'PR submitted: https://github.com/squirrel289/temple/pull/11'
      - Remote CI currently failing across required checks; see process-pr status.
